# Parzibot

## _Powerful and Useful Discord Bot on Python._

The source code of the bot is available to everyone. Parzibot uses English language. This is free open-source
software and if anyone wants to change things in advance. Just before using my code, please write to me
on _[Twitter](https://twitter.com/merive_)_.
