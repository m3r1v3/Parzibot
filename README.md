# Parzibot

### _Simple and convenient bot discord on Python._

The source code of the bot is available to everyone. The bot used the English language. This is free open source
software and if anyone wants to change things in advance. Just before using my code, please write to me
on _[Twitter](https://twitter.com/merive_)_.

**I will be pleased to know that someone uses my work🙂.**
